The code stick_new.sh provided is a Bash script that performs several operations based on the contents of a file called "best_parameters.txt". The script contains a loop that reads each line of the file, assigns values to variables, and executes various commands based on those variables. Finally, it can calculate the sticking coefficient to the sysmtem.

In the standard deviation analysis, we can replicate the measurement to obtain robust statistical values and identify the most precise parameter that reproduces the experimental sticking coefficient.
