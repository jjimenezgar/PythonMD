Parameterization of a Morse potential for Pt-H2:

* In the Morse_Pt-H2 folder, you will find the code that allows you to calculate thousands of parameters that reproduce the reported E(activation) and E(ads) using DFT.

* In the sticking_coefficient_method folder, you will find the code that allows you to reproduce the sticking coefficient experiment.

* Within this folder, you can recalculate the SC (10 times) using the parameters that reproduce the SC close to the experimental value and filter the best parameters with a standard deviation (std) of less than 0.5, in order to select the parameter that is closest to the experimental value.
